POST /url - gives the shorten vesion of my given url 

GET /url/:id - redirects to the original id




AUTHENTICATION 
STATFULL - USING COOKIES WHERE ONCE USER LOGGED IN, A UNIQUE ID IS GENERATED AND THAT ID USED FOR FURTHER PURPOSE

IF PAGE RESTARTS OR REFRESHES THAN USER AUTOMATICALLY LOGGED OUT WHICH WE DONT WANT.

STATELESS - NOW EVERYTIME USER HAVE TO LOGGIN AS SERVER STARTS AS UUID GENERAETD IS STORED IN BROWESER.

SO WHAT WE DO IS ASSIGN A TOKEN TO EACH USER AND TO THAT TOKEN WE APPLY SOME SECRET KEY.

SO NOW EVEN IF SERVER RESTARTS THE TOKEN FOR THAT USER IS AS IT IS AND IT WILL BE VERIFIED BY THE GIVEN SECRET KEY SO USER CAN DIRECTLY ACCESS EVERYTHING WHERE LEFT.

IF SOMEONE TRY TO MANIPULATE TOKEN THEN IT WILL RAISE ERROR AS THAT TOKEN IS NOT VERIFIED BY MY SECRET KEY.

SIMILAR TO HOW THE CURRENCY OR ANY ID IS DETECTED BASED ON WATERMARK OR SOME SIGNATURE.

HOWEVER IF SOMEONE GET THE ACESS TO SECRET KEY THAN THE DATA CAN BE MANIPULATED AND ALL THE NEW TOKENS WILL THEN VERIFIED BY THE SECRET KEY.

TOKENS HAVE LONGER LIFETIME THAN ID'S.
